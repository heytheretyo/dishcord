# dishcord

> [!NOTE]
> this app is just an experimental to test my project management skills (ci/cd, scrum, monorepo), sounds like a dumby project but i hope its a good idea.

social discovery app for discordians, especially for people with no friends... (not me actually). basically u can sign up and swipe and search for people in discord who are not friends yet, then u can talk to them in discord. eg: if ur looking for s1 to play with, u can just find them here. in a nutshell its just a crud app.

# development

currently built using the infamous MANN stack: composing of nestjs and angular, part of the verbose family.
